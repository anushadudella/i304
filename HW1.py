HW1 - 8 Problems, 100 points total

Each problem is contained in a function that is invoked at the bottom of this file.
If you do not want to run the code for a given problem, simply comment out that 
problem number's function at the bottom of this file.

Each problem contains an initial print statement that shows the problem number.  
DO NOT CHANGE THIS. Add your code below the instructions for the problem.


Notes on Using Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
------------------------------------------
IF COMMENTS ABOVE ARE NOT WRAPPING IN VSCode, GO TO SETTINGS (GEAR ICON IN THE LOWER 
LEFT), TYPE "wrap" IN THE SEARCH BOX, AND SET "Editor: Word Wrap" TO "on"


Notes on Grading
----------------
The point value of each problem is noted in a comment above the problem 

Producing the correct answer alone is not enough by itself to receive full-credit. Just as it's important to show your work in completing math problems, your solution should be easy for another person to read and understand both your approach (i.e., *how* you tried to solve the problem) as well as *why* you pursued that approach. 

Writing meaningful comments is an important part of this: explaining what you are *intending* to do at each step, even if the actual translation of this intent into actual Python ultimately proves erroneous. More specifically, you should write your human-readable "pseudocode" as comments first, convince yourself that your "algorithm" in pseudocode is correct, and then translate your pseudocode into real Python code (that the computer can execute). 

Using meaningful variables names also helps make your Python program clearer to others and more "self-documenting". 

In grading each problem, the AA will ask questions such as:

* Does your program run without errors?

* How correct is the solution: all, mostly, some, none? 

* For partial credit, how much of the problem was attempted?

* Did you "show your work" in a way the AA can understand. For example, in real-world programming job, would another developer that was trying to make sense of your code be able to do so, in order to extend your code with new functionality, or to find and fix any "bugs" in your code)?

  - Did you include comments, and more specifically the pseudocode for your algorithm to solve the problem?

  - Did you use meaningful variable names?

* Did you follow class "coding conventions":

  - Did you use snake_case for naming variables, and UPPERCASE names for constants? 

  - Did you use whitespace (blank lines and spaces) to make your code readable?

    This is a demonstration example only; it is already solved for you.
    
    Note that you must indent each line. This is because in Python, indentation effects program interpretation, so if you do not indent your Python code consistently, it will fail to run with an error, or run but produce erroneous output.

    Example problem: output the sum of 2 and 3

    In mathematics long division, standard terminology is that the 

        Dividend / Divisor = Quotient and Remainder.  
        
    For example, 7 / 2 = 3 remainder 1

    Prompt the user for two integer inputs. Store these in variables named dividend and divisor. 

    Print the integer quotient (ie, the results of integer division) and the remainder.

    To verify your program is working correctly, test it by running it on different inputs and verifying that it produces the correct, expected output in case. To be clear, this testing is not code for you to submit, but manual testing for you to perform to verify the accuracy of your program.  For example consider the test cases below.

    Test Case(s):
        * 1/3 = 0 remainder 1 
        * 11/3 = 3 remainder 2
        * 5/2 = 2 remainder 1
